# Marble Game (Final Project for BE534)

This is my final project for the BE534 class. It's inspired by the marble game in the TV show "Squid Game" Season 1 Episode 6.

The objective of the game is to collect all the marbles. This game involves two players. Each player begins with the same number of marbles (can use the -n argument to choose from 10/15/20/25). They have to pick some number of marbles in their fist and ask the opposite player to guess whether he/she has an empty or odd or even number of marbles. If the guess is correct then the player who is playing has to return those marbles to the opposite player, if guess is wrong then the opposite player has to give that many numbers of marbles to the player Both of them will get an alternative turn to play. At the end, whoever has all the marbles will be the winner.
